# Feedreader Project for Front-End Nanodegree Program @Udacity
I've been given the project by Udacity with a task - to write a test suits. So I've changed only 'feedreader.js' file.

## How to run
You can clone my repository and than open file index.html in your browser.

## How to test
After the page loads, the tests will run and will be displayed at the bottom of the page.

## Dependencies
jQuery 1.11.1 - jQuery is a fast, small, and feature-rich JavaScript library. It makes things like HTML document traversal and manipulation, event handling, animation, and Ajax much simpler with an easy-to-use API that works across a multitude of browsers. With a combination of versatility and extensibility, jQuery has changed the way that millions of people write JavaScript. https://jquery.com

For testing I used Jasmine: https://jasmine.github.io/pages/getting_started.html
